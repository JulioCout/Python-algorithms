# In this algorithm the objective is to scroll through a set of data looking for two components that add up will give the result i'm looking for.

# Commonly this type of algorithms use two pointer, one that stay in one element and other that run through the array comparing other elements with the first one.
# But this solution isn't very eficienty, it's O(nÂ²).
# Instead i can use just one pointer that run through the array just one time creating a hashmap and comparing the each next element with the elements in the hashmap.
# With this solution i will have O(n) efficiency.

# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
